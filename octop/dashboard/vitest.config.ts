 * Standalone Vitest config — kept separate from ``vite.config.ts`` so:
 * 1. The PWA plugin and SPA build tweaks don't run for unit tests
 *    (they pull heavy deps and slow startup by ~3 s).
 * 2. We can keep ``test.environment`` / ``setupFiles`` in one obvious
 *    place without polluting the prod build config.
